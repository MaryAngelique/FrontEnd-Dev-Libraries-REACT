The last several challenges covered the basic ways to pass props to child components. But what if the child component that you're passing a prop to is an ES6 class component, rather than a stateless functional component? The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.

Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the this keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with this. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called data, you write {this.props.data} in JSX.

Render an instance of the Welcome component in the parent component App. Here, give Welcome a prop of name and assign it a value of a string. Within the child, Welcome, access the name prop within the strong tags.

Tests
The App component should return a single div element.
The child of App should be the Welcome component.
The Welcome component should have a prop called name.
The Welcome component should display the string you pass as the name prop within strong tags.
